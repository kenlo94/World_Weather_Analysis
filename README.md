# WeatherPy with Python APIs

### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create 3 deliverables:

1. Retrieve Weather Data
2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Results

We were able to:
1. Generate and Export a Weather dataframe to a csv using an API call containing Latitude and Longitude, Max Temp, Percent Humidity, Percent Cloudiness, Wind Speed, and Weather Description
2. Generate and Export a Hotel dataframe to a csv using an API call containing City, Country, Max Temp, Current Description, Latitude and Longitude, and Hotel Name
3. Generate and Save an image of a map with markers and popup information containing hotel information
4. Create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations
5. Create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary


### Summary

Overall, I am very pleased with how this challenge turned out. We were able to generate dataframes using several API calls to export them as csv's and generate several maps to export them as png's.
